# Amazon-Clone-Using-HTML-CSS-JavaScript
This is my very first proper front-end project in which I tried to create a clone of the famous E-commerce website Amazon.com

This is created using HTML,CSS and Vanilla Javascript. The page is created exclusively for big screens only therefore the design is not responsive.

# TechStack Used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
